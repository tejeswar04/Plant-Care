# 🌱 Smart Plant Watering System 💧

This project involves an embedded system built with **Arduino Uno** and various sensors to predict when a plant requires water. The system uses a **logistic regression model** to analyze soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data, providing an intelligent irrigation solution. The project was prototyped using **TinkerCAD** for simulation.

## 🚀 Features
- **Arduino Uno**: Central control unit for processing sensor data. 🖥️
- **Sensors**: Soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors to monitor plant conditions. 🌡️💧
- **Logistic Regression**: Predicts plant watering needs based on sensor data. 📊
- **TinkerCAD Prototype**: Simulation of the system for demonstration. 💻

## 📋 Requirements
- **Arduino Uno** board 🔌
- **Soil Moisture Sensor** 🌱
- **Temperature and Humidity Sensor** 🌡️
- **TinkerCAD** for simulation 💻

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. **Hardware Setup**: 
   - Connect the **soil moisture sensor**, **temperature and humidity sensor**, and **Arduino Uno** using the appropriate pins.
   
2. **Software Setup**:
   - Install **Arduino IDE** for code uploading.
   - Open the provided project files in the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the code to the **Arduino Uno**.

3. **TinkerCAD Setup**:
   - Import the provided TinkerCAD simulation file.
   - Start the simulation to view real-time sensor data and system behavior.

---

## 🤖 How It Works
- The system continuously monitors soil moisture, temperature, and humidity levels using sensors.
- The collected data is processed through a **logistic regression model**, which predicts if the plant needs watering.
- The result is displayed as an action (e.g., activating a water pump or alerting the user).
